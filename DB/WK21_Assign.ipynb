    "\n",
    "A database is a collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. \n",
    "Databases are used to store, maintain, and access any type of data. \n",
    "They can be used to support a wide range of activities, including: Data storage, Data analysis, Data management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are usually accessed through a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS is an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of databases: \n",
    "1. An online telephone directory\n",
    "2. A customer table\n",

    "\n",
    "File-based storage systems are hierarchical storage systems that store data in files and folders. The data is organized and retrieved using a limited amount of metadata that tells the computer exactly where the file itself is kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major challenges of file-based storage systems\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "File-based storage systems can be difficult to scale to large sizes. As the amount of data stored increases, the system can become slow and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability:\n",
    "File-based storage systems are vulnerable to data loss or corruption. If a file or folder is corrupted, it can be difficult or impossible to recover the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "File-based storage systems can be vulnerable to security breaches. If a user or application is able to access unauthorized files, it can result in data loss or theft."

    "## 3.What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.\n",
    "eg .SQL, Monogo DB\n",
    "\n",

    "Here are some challenges of file-based storage systems that are tackled by DBMS: \n",
    "Data security :\n",
    "File-based systems have low data security because data is easily accessible and there are no security mechanisms to protect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data inconsistency :\n",
    "Data redundancy is the main cause of data inconsistency. For example, if you change an employee's mobile number in one place but forget to edit it in another place, this would lead to data inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data isolation :\n",
    "Data is scattered in various files, and files may be in different formats. This makes it difficult to write new application programs to retrieve the appropriate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency problem :\n",
    "Concurrent access to data means more than one user is accessing the same data at the same time. Anomalies occur when changes made by one user get lost because of changes made by another user. File systems do not provide any procedure to stop anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomicity :\n",
    "File processing systems do not provide the facility to ensure the atomicity of data."
