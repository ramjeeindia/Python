BIG DATA -Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex	
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>		
Hadoop-	Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models,Alernative like Cloudera, Hortonworks, AWS (AMR)	

Hive-	A data warehouse infrastructure that provides data summarization and ad hoc querying.WORKS ON TOP OF HADOOP	

Hbase-	A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables	

Spark-	Processing Engine .A fast and general compute engine for Hadoop data. Spark provides a simple and expressive programming model that supports a wide range of applications, including ETL, machine learning, stream processing, and graph computation.	

Kafka-Messaging System.Apache Kafka is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform. It is an open-source system developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Java and Scala. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.		

Oozie-Apache Oozie is a server-based workflow scheduling system to manage Hadoop jobs.Xml based system, Alernative Airflow		

Sqoop-Sqoop is a command-line interface application for transferring data between relational databases and Hadoop.	

			
zookepper-	Feedback system or maintain a session .Apache ZooKeeper is an open-source server for highly reliable distributed coordination of cloud applications.

Data is like a crude oil. We can define according to ypes of data and choose sturactural means a data like schema/dbo/ table like SQL, ORACLE types and non-structural like pdf, jpg				
and semi structure means having schema but flow all types of data like facebook data , linkedin , whatsapp
